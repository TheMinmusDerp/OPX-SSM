		#LOC_OPX-SSM_Minmus_Desc_Hilda = One of the larger objects in the Kerbolar asteroid belt, Minmus orbits near the outer edge of the belt in a 3:2 resonance with the giant planet Jool. Its surface is unsurprisingly composed of ice, but spectral analysis also shows some form of glass being present in abundance on the Minmar surface. Minmus' orbit and unique resonance takes it through the vicinity of Jool's L3, L4, and L5 points in sequence, a phenomenon so far unique to it. 
		#LOC_OPX-SSM_Minmus_Desc_Trojan = Once believed to be a moon of Kerbin, the square heads at the Nye Island Observatory determined that it in fact orbits Kerbol. However, it is largely unique in the fact that it orbits in Kerbin's leading lagrange point. This means that it will always orbit within the vicinity of 60 degrees ahead of Kerbin's position in its orbit, making transfers to it possible and easy at any time.
